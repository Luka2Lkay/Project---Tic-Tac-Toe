The Odin Project Coding Exercise.

This is a basic Tic Tac Toe, a game that you can play in your browser. My future plans with this project:

1) Create at least two rounds of play
2) Create a better interface that inputs players' names.(instead of using prompts)
3) Apply media queries so the website can respond beautifuly to devices of varying widths.
